abstract: The objective is to identify the capacity to provide good access to facilities and equipment that favor water consumption within the University of Panama, as part of its commitment to promote behaviors that benefit health in this community. A descriptive statistical study and multivariate analysis were carried out, using the correspondence analysis technique between the variables *University Estates* (students, faculty and administrative staff) vs *Access to water sources* and *Access to water sources* vs *Instruments to facilitate water consumption*. It was concluded that 66.3 percent of the respondents recognized water as the most accessible beverage for consumption, mainly from water sources, followed by bottled water.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
