abstract: Currently, the debate on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and the strategies implemented by organizations to publicize their corporate actions is fueling the discussion on aspects aimed at sustainable development. To showcase their CSR strategies, one of the mechanisms used by companies is the presentation of sustainability reports. In this paper, we have modified the analysis approach traditionally used to demonstrate the characteristic factors of transparency in the field of CSR. Specifically, we focus on analyzing which indicators are the least disclosed by companies. Within this framework, the aim of this paper is to analyze the dissemination practices of environmental information from the sustainability reports of the global reporting initiative produced by large companies, in order to establish differences and similarities in terms of corporate social responsibility. The results obtained for a sample of 80 large companies and 67 multinational enterprises (MNEs) indicate a slight difference in the disclosure of environmental indicators. Specifically, the results reveal that 56.12% of environmental indicators are not disclosed by large companies; whereas, in MNEs, 51.23% of these indicators are not reported. In large companies, the greatest deficiencies in the disclosure of environmental information correspond to the categories of biodiversity, environmental complaint mechanisms and effluents and waste. In the case of MNCs, the least disclosed categories are biodiversity, environmental complaint mechanisms and environmental protection expenditures and investments (in general).
