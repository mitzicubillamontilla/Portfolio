I am a professor of statistics at the University of Panama, at the undergraduate, master and doctoral levels. I am also a member of the National Research System, as a researcher of the National Secretariat of Science, Technology and Innovation (SENACYT).

My research turns around multivariate analysis, software development and Big Data. This research is carried out with multidisciplinary teams.
